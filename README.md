### DESCRIPTION:

	
> "Is that a page from the dastardly villain’s diary?” Maldynado asked. <br>
> “One carelessly dropped that conveniently reveals the secret to destroying these vile artifacts?”<br>
> “It’s an invoice.”<br>
> “Villains get bills?"<br>
> 
> — Lindsay Buroker *Dark Currents (The Emperor's Edge, #2)*

*This project is a simple invoice creator built with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.*

### CHALLENGES I OVERCAME:

Specific things I learned included: 

- [x] I expanded on the original project by creating a modal that alerts you in case you put the same invoice more than once

- [x] Instead of only being able to order one action only once, I made it so you can now order it multiple times if you like

- [x] Made it so items can be subtracted from the invoice

### MY OWN PERSONAL CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDED:
